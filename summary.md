Questions
1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
2. Why the test failed at first?
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?

-- TEST1 - should_be_immutable
1. To learn what is the use of String.replace
2. It is failed when you first saw it and after changed it to my desired output it passed since my understanding is correct in String.replace function
3. I corrected it because optional is empty, and after change in my first try, it doesn't throw failed so i didn't corrected my test at first try.
4. None

-- TEST2 - all_modification_method_will_create_new_string

3. I corrected the unchanged code, and after change in my first try, it doesn't throw failed so i didn't corrected my test at first try.
4. None

-- TEST4 - should_taken_string_apart
1. To learn how to apply the learning we learned in the above tests.
2. It is failed when you first saw it and after changed it to my desired output it passed since i use replace function to remove part of string
3. I corrected the unchanged code, and after change in my first try, it doesn't throw failed so i didn't corrected my test at first try.
4. None

-- TEST5 - should_taken_string_apart_continued
1. To learn how to apply the learning we learned in the above tests.
2. It is failed when you first saw it and after changed it to my desired output it passed since i use replace function to remove part of string
3. I corrected the unchanged code, and after change in my first try, it doesn't throw failed so i didn't corrected my test at first try.
4. None

1. To learn how split string into array of characters https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/01/how-to-split-string-based-on-delimiter-in-java.html
2. It is failed when you first saw it and after changed it to my desired output it passed since i use String.split to separate each words in to array of characters
3. I corrected the unchanged code, and after change in my first try, it doesn't throw failed so i didn't corrected my test at first try.
4. None

2. It is failed when you first saw it and after changed it to my desired output it passed since i use String.split to separate each words in to array of characters
3. I corrected it the unchanged code, and after change in my first try, it doesn't throw failed so i didn't corrected my test at first try.
4. None

-- TEST8 - should_create_ascii_art
1. To learn how to use String builder
2. It is failed when you first saw it and after changed it to my desired output it passed since i know how to use String builder
3. I corrected it the unchanged code, and after change in my first try, it doesn't throw failed so i didn't corrected my test at first try.
4. None

-- TEST9 - should_calculate_checksum_of_a_string
1. To learn how to create logic of checksum in a string. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34124310/calculate-checksum-for-the-string
2. It is failed when you first saw it and after changed with my own logic it failed since i have wrong logic for checking the sum of checksum. after searching ways how to do it, already got the correct answer and logic
